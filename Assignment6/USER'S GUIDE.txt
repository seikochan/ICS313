USER'S GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started:
Download all files (project.lisp, add_objects.lisp, add_locations.lisp, add_paths.lisp, add_actions.lisp) to a single directory.
Navigate to above directory in the terminal.
Load the "project.lisp" in whichever Lisp environment (ie. Clisp, Allegro, etc).


Description:
You had left your house early this morning looking to buy some food from the market.  Along the way, you say some lovely flowers by a castle.  You went over and started plucking some to bring home.  Unfortunately, this garden belonged to a Duke and he seemed very upset about having others touch his garden.  He was so upset, he threw you in his dungeons to rot away!

In this game, you are a prisoner caught trying to steal some flowers from the Duke's garden.  You were captured and put in the dungeon.  Your goal is to successfully escape from the Duke's 
castle to regain your freedom.  If you need help along the way, just type 'help?'.


Strategy Tips:
-If you have no idea what to do next, try typing 'help?', and it will provide you with a list of currently availiable commands. If you see a new command, try it out!

-If you don't really know how to use a specific action command, type 'help commandName'.  It will tell you what parameters it takes.

-Don't be afraid to explore and pickup different things.

-If you are not sure how to use a function, use 'quit' to get out of game-repl mode, then use the documentation function to view the function's documentation string.
	ie.    (documentation 'functionName 'function)  ->   (documentation 'run 'function)
