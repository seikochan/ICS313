You had left your house early this morning looking to buy some food from the market.  Along the way, you say some lovely flowers by a castle.  You went over and started plucking some  to bring home.  Unfortunately, this garden belonged to a Duke and he seemed very upset about   having others touch his garden.  He was so upset, he threw you in his dungeons to rot away!
